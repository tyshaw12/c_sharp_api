## OpenWeather API App
This is a C# console application that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API based on a user input city name. The app uses the System.Net.Http and System.Text.Json libraries to make HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeather API and parse the JSON responses into C# objects.

### Requirements
To use this app, you will need:

.NET 5.0 SDK
You will also need an API key from OpenWeather. You can sign up for a free API key on the OpenWeather website.

When prompted, enter the name of a city for which you want to retrieve weather data. For example, you could enter "London" or "New York".

The app will retrieve the current temperature in Fahrenheit for the requested city from the OpenWeather API and display it in the console.

### Customization
You can customize this app in many ways, such as:
